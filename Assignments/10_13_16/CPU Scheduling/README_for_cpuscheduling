# CPU Scheduling algorithms 



1. FIFO 
2. RR 
3. SJF 
4. PRIORITY (NON PRIMPTIVE) 
5. HRRN
6. PRIORITY (PRIMPTIVE) 
7. SRTF



-------------------------------------------------

Commands for Executing : 
	$ cc processes.c
	$ ./a.out 


Input :- 
	Input is stored in file . 
	Columns are 
		process_id	Arrival_time	Burst_time	Priority 

	Example :- 
		In file namesd processes , contents are 

		p1	0	3	5
		p2	2	6	3
		p3	4	4	2
		p4	6	5	4
		p5	8	4	1


Output : 

	Firstly processes are displayed . Then output of CPU scheduling algorithms are displayed one by one.
	Value in bracket shows current time 



Executable :
	File 'a.out' is executable . 





Implemenation :

	Data structures used are :
		Array 
		Linked list (For storing processes from file).
		Circular linked list (for RR algo) .
